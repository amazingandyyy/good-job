## Resursion

1. Identfiy the base case
2. Identify the recursive case
3. Get closer and closer and return when needed. Usually you have 2 returns.

Theory: Anthing you can do with a recursion can be done interatively

pros & cons:

- Better readability
- Large stack, can be costly
- when it comes to sorting or tree traversal, it becomes really simplier

when to use resursion:

- Everytime you are using a tree or converting something into a tree
 - 1. devided into number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
 - 2. each instance of the subproblem is identical in nature
 - 3. the solutions of each subproblem can be combined to solve the problem at hand
- Devide and conquer using recursion
