# System Design questions

1. Talk through a high-level design and give an explanation for a more detailed design of each component.
- What components will we need?
- How will they communicate?
- With what data?
- How should we store it?
- Where should we expect bottlenecks, and how might we handle them? At this part, we expect to cover topics such as **caching**, **load balancing**, **data stores**, **existing solutions**, etc.
- identified concerns with certain high-level considerations such as
  - performance
  - offline mode
  - security vulnerabilities, and technology choice.

2. Drill down into lower level areas like
- database schemas
- UI interactions
- and memory usage
- data structure and algor.
