Here's an example of what I would say if it was the end of the interview and I want to essentially end

off the interview on a good note thank you for your time.

I'm sure you have lots of candidates to see but I want to say one last thing.

There are no shortages of developers for you to interview.

However there is a shortage of good talented ego less developers with ambition to learn.

It's not the ones that are unable to admit that they are wrong.

The best developers aren't the ones that know the language inside and out at the expense of having blinders.

It is not the ones who are unable to admit they are wrong.

I am not the most experienced developer that you may interview today but the one thing that you can

guarantee is that there is nobody that you will interview that will work as hard to develop his or her

skill every day.

Play nicely with all the other developers that the company isn't so narrow minded and problem solving

that he or she isn't willing to try new and novel ideas.

When you hire me you will rest assured that you won't have to micromanage me.

You don't have to extinguish fires.

And in one year I'll be one of your most valuable employees.

I can guarantee you that I'm at a point in my career where I want to be surrounded by a team that I

can grow with and be surrounded by smart people like yourself.

And I've chosen this company specific for that reason.

And you've probably had similar experiences in your career where one company allows you to really have

an impact and propel your career.

I'm at this stage now and I hope to be part of the team with you.

So thank you for your time and I hope to hear back soon from you.
