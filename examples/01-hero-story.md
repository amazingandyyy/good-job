A couple of years back when I would start this small little side businesses and I would hire developers

and designers to build a web site or an app for me and it was always a block box where I would pay this

developer money and they'll come back with a product that I was never fully satisfied for.

So I started teaching myself how to code because I wanted to know how this black box works.

And the more I learned the more I learned I became really interested really in golf in the programming

landscape and I just started consuming as much information as I can practicing as much as I can.

I started building projects and then this is where you can talk about some of your big portfolio projects

and all of a sudden I started writing blog posts about technical subjects that got received very well

and I guess what I'm trying to say is that through these projects and through these posts every day

I'm becoming better and better as a coder to the point that now I feel very confident and being able

to be a valuable asset to your team not just now but even a year from now where I expect my skills to

exponentially grow.
